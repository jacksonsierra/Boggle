# Boggle
Implementation of the classic game Boggle. This was part of the third assignment submitted in Stanford's Programming Abstractions class.

The assignment focused on the actual implementation of the game, accurately tracking the scores, updating the UI, etc. rather than creating the UI itself, which was given. As such all edits are confined to the header and source files for 'Boggle' and 'boggleplay,' which represented the state of the game and the client used to update the UI, respectively.

The full spec is included under 'Assignment_04_Recursion.pdf' in the repository, pages 10-20.
